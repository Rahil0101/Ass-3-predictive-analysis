1.Split data into feature and target variable

2.Applied RandomOverSampler to balance the  dataset

3.Used sampling techniques: Simple Random Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Stratified Sampling to generate samples of the training set.

4.Trained classification models over the samples: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K Neighbours Classifier, GaussianNB and SVC

5.Calculated accuracy for each model
